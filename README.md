- Use [my chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/uw-madison-course-search/ldnllmdimjknflobmdjnmefeollalodf?pli=1) if you are a UW student or just check out [the code](https://github.com/JackBlake-zkq/cse-plus)
- Check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-h-blake/) (I refuse to post on any social media but you can see my professional history)
- I've done some cool work with [Data Science for Sustainable Development](https://dssdglobal.org/) aka DSSD
    - I led the development of [this web framework](https://github.com/DSSD-Madison/student-hub-website-framework). It's meant for DSSD's student chapters but has great learning resources, infrastructure, and step-by-step instructions for the development of any content focussed website
    - I led the development of a couple solar dashboards, each with unique challanges
        - [this one](https://github.com/DSSD-Madison/couillard) has some cool webscraping and GitHub Actions stuff going on
        - [this one](https://github.com/DSSD-Madison/Helios) deals with fetching dozens of files over the internet concurrently
    - Had something like 30 PRs merged for the [Eirene Peacebuilding Database](https://eirene.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/) project
        - unfortunately it's a private repo but you could delve into my Contribution Activity for summer 2022 if you really wanted to fact check, or just hit me up on LinkedIn and I can connect you with people who can verify
